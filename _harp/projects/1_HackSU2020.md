## What is this?
REDACTED was a finalist for HackSU 2020. It was developed in NodeJS and used SocketIO. 

## What does it do?
The theme of the hackathon was 'Technology in Society', so we decided to create a technology that said a lot about society. REDACTED is a single room chat application that allows its users to censor certain words, for everyone. When the chat first starts up, it has no redacted words, SO the users can types whatever they want. If a user deems a word offensive, they can type  

> REDACT [insert word]

After that, if a user tries to use that word, it will be redacted when it pop up in the chat. This forces users to find new ways of communicating without certain words.
